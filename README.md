House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms using a linear regression model. The dataset used contains information about various houses including their square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the corresponding sale prices.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in a CSV file named house_price.csv. It includes the following columns:

. Square Footage: The total square footage of the house.

. Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.

. Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house.

. Price ($): The sale price of the house.

Requirements
To run the code in this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

. Python 3.x

. pandas

. scikit-learn

. matplotlib (for plotting)

You can install the required packages using pip:

Usage
Clone this repository or download the house_price.csv file.
Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
Run the house_price_prediction.py script to train the linear regression model and make predictions.
Code Structure

. house_price.csv: CSV file containing the dataset.

. house_price_prediction.py: Python script for training the linear regression model and making predictions.

. README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

Results
After running the house_price_prediction.py script, you will get the mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score as evaluation metrics for the model. Additionally, a scatter plot will be generated showing the predicted versus actual prices of the houses.
